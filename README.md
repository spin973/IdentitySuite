# IdentitySuite Demo Projects

This repository contains two demo projects that demonstrate how to configure the **IdentitySuite** library in different scenarios. There is also a **Clients** section where you can find configuration examples of some types of clients.

## Repository Structure

- **BasicConfiguration**: Minimum configuration required to get IdentitySuite up and running.
- **AdvancedConfiguration**: Advanced example with customization of OpenIddict endpoints.
- **Clients**: Some projects with minimal configuration to play with:
  - **BlazorClient**: Blazor web application, Authorization code flow + PKCE, use access tokens for the Web API
  - **MvcClient**: ASP.NET Core MVC web application, a server-side application using OpenID Connect, use access tokens for the Web API
  - **ClientCredentialFlow**: Console application, a client using the Client Credentials flow, request access tokens for the Web API
  - **ResourceOwnerFlow**: Console application, a client using the Resource Owner Password Credentials flow, request access tokens for the Web API
  - **DeviceAuthorizationFlow**: Console application, a client using the Device Authorization flow, request access tokens for the Web API
  - **WebApi**: ASP.NET Core Web API application, a resource using introspection to validate tokens
  - More to come

## BasicConfiguration

The project in the `BasicConfiguration` folder shows the essential configuration to integrate IdentitySuite into your project.

### Configuration
1. Configure your database by editing the connection string in: `/IdentitySuite/identitySuiteSettings.Development.json`
2. Run `dotnet restore`
3. Start the project with `dotnet run`

## AdvancedConfiguration

The project in the `AdvancedConfiguration` folder demonstrates how to customize OpenIddict endpoints to meet your specific needs.

### Demonstrated Features
- Customize Authorization Endpoints

### Configuration
1. Configure your database by editing the connection string in: `/IdentitySuite/identitySuiteSettings.Development.json`
2. Run `dotnet restore`
3. Start the project with `dotnet run`


## Using Clients

You can use the clients in the `Client` folder to test the IdentitySuite server. Each client has its own configuration and can run independently or simultaneously (according to your license). Each client has the ability to call the `WebAPI` server (weatherforecast endpoint) to verify that authentication is working.

## What's New in Version 1.1.0

Version 1.1.0 introduces several major improvements:

- üöÄ **Configurable Rate Limiting**: Added rate limiting for all endpoints with real-time metrics dashboard
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Extended Configuration Options**: New OpenIddict settings for advanced scenarios:
  - Data protection configuration (enable/disable)
  - Access token encryption settings (enable/disable)
- ‚úÖ **Standards Compliance**: Overhauled all OIDC/OAuth2 endpoints for full OpenID Connect certification readiness

## Upgrade from version 1.0.x to 1.1.0

When upgrading from version 1.0.x to 1.1.0, follow these steps:

1. **Before updating the package**:
   - Modify your application configuration by enabling the `Apply migrations` option located in the `Database Settings` section of the `General` menu
   - This is necessary because the database structure has changed and migrations need to be applied

2. Update the IdentitySuite package to version 1.1.0
3. Run your application - the migrations will be applied automatically
